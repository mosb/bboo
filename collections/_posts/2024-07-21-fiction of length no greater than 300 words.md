300 words is not much, but as this is intended to be fiction, I will simply lie about my life, mostly by shameless omission, until my story fits. To begin, my primary reason for continuing to tolerate existence is my responsibilities, but it is exactly those responsibilities that make existence so intolerable. You may wonder—why not simply shuck off those responsibilities—but those responsibilities are all owed to people that I unambiguously love. I acknowledge that my suffering is fundamentally absurd, as bearing commitments to those I love, especially given my generous allocation of good fortune, should not lead to intolerable existence. But I think suffering is always, at its root, absurd—what meaning does our universe provide other than the vision of painted clowns dancing upon quantum foam, sinking into the foam, until all one can see are the tips of their overlong shoes. Indeed, it is clowns who leaven my depression, the clowns that I can always see, sometimes just out of the corner of my eye, sometimes beneath me, in a hole or stairwell, sometimes hiding at the top of a tree or cell-phone tower, because—clowns that no one else can see, but that move everyone's limbs by use of strings? Absurd! Who wouldn’t get a few laughs out of that? I must declare here that a sense of humour is perhaps my most important survival skill. When my partner said that they and our children would never forgive me if I did it, I laughed, not in a mocking way, but because I had spotted my own and my partner’s mouths tugged by the clowns’ strings, and it is hard not to be somewhat entertained by the antics of the clowns, evil as they may be.
